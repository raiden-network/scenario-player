"""Prometheus Metrics used to monitor our flask applications.

Available metrics are:

    http_requests_total
        The total number of requests made to the application.

    http_exceptions_total
        The total number of exceptions raised during processing or requests. Please
        note that *404 Not Found* errors caused by requesting incorrect URLs are **NOT**
        included in this metric, since they are raised during routing, before the
        execution of any of our endpoint functions.

        However, `404 Not Found` exceptions raised explicitly by our functions
        are monitored.

    http_requests_latency_seconds
        The number of seconds required to process requests to endpoints of the
        application.

`method` and `path` labels are available for all metrics, allowing more granular
filtering using PromQL.
